# jsmetrics_analysis_runner

This code details an analysis runner for data on the JASMIN supercomputer. It runs jet latitude statistics using the _jsmetrics_ Python package.
I plan to release (more) detailed documentation of how to use this code during the preparation of a manuscript on 'uncertainty associated with shifts in the North Pacific jet stream.'
